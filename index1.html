    <h1> Introduction to IT Basics</h1>
        <p> <b> Information Technology (IT) is an essential aspect of modern life, influencing how we communicate, work, and entertain ourselves. Understanding the basics of IT involves exploring its core components—hardware, software, networking, and the role of IT in modern organizations. This section will provide an overview of these fundamental concepts to offer a foundational understanding of the IT landscape</b></p> 
        <h2> <strong> A. Hardware</strong></h2>
        <p> Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system. These components are tangible and interact with software to perform various tasks.</p>

        <h3><strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</strong> </h3>
        <img src="cpu.jpg">
        <p> Often referred to as the "brain" of the computer, the CPU executes instructions from software to perform basic arithmetic, logic, control, and input/output (I/O) operations.</p>
        <p> The CPU consists of the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), which handles mathematical and logical operations, and the Control Unit (CU), which directs the operation of the processor.</p>
        <p> CPUs vary in speed and efficiency, with multicore processors offering parallel processing capabilities that enhance performance, especially for complex computing tasks. </p>
        
        <h3> <strong> Memory and Storage </strong></h3>
<ul> 
    <li>Random Access Memory (RAM)</li>
    <img src="ram.jpg">
    <p> RAM is volatile memory that temporarily stores data and programs that are currently in use, allowing the CPU to access them quickly. More RAM can improve system performance by reducing the need to access slower storage solutions.</p>
</ul> 
<li> Storage Devices </li>
<ul>
    <li>Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) Use spinning disks to read and write data. While traditionally less expensive and offering more storage space, HDDs are slower and more prone to mechanical failure.
